## :black_nib: Description

For the Kickoff within the Minor Web Design & Development ([@cmda-minor-web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web)) we created a business card with only HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.

This is part of the team page that has been set up by team [Roodbots](https://github.com/BVictorB/teampagina).

This repository shows my personal business card from a created API.
